## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.plants`: Add plants from the list of plants available
- `myExtension.shouldNotify`: When this is enabled, the Garden extension will notify the user when it is time to water their plants (and drink water themselves!) This uses the water notification time value to determine the cadence of notifications.
- `myExtension.waterNotificationTime`: This is the time between notifications to water the plants, in minutes. The default value is 30 minutes. If shouldNotify is disabled, this value is ignored.

## Known Issues

No issues at this time.
